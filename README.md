If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!

|------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | Primitive datum    | F0. A feeling exists that contains multiple simultaneous contrasts.¹                                          | Denying any clause is itself a felt contrast (self‑instantiating).           | –                           |
| 1    | Phenomenology      | F1. Contrasts are numerous.<br>F2. Some contrasts refer to contrasts no longer present.<br>F3. Contrasts vary in felt strength (salience). Salience is observed, not assumed. | Direct properties of F0.                                                     | salience                    |
| 2    | Capacity limits    | C1. Unlimited storage **and bandwidth** would keep every micro‑contrast at equal strength, erasing salience (F3).<br>C2. Finite capacity implies loss; references to absent contrasts (F2) reveal incompleteness. | Contraposition of F3 ⇒ capacity is finite.<br>Contraposition of F2.          | capacity, incompleteness    |
| 3    | Compression        | S1. Finite capacity forces selective retention of contrasts (compression).<br>S2. A retained trace that stands‑in for a discarded contrast functions as memory, and is lossy by nature. | From C1.<br>From C2 + F2.                                                    | memory                      |
| 4    | Pattern extraction | P1. Compression must select regularities that minimise future code length, producing predictions.<br>P2. Predictions clustered around the host’s recurring contrasts form a proto‑self model (recursive tag). | Shorter code wins by contradiction, given S1.<br>Cluster centre = locus of F0. | prediction, self model      |
| 5    | World partition    | E1. Retained regularities not tagged self form a world model.<br>E2. Self‑like regularities inside that world model become models of other minds, though accuracy may vary. | Partition P1 relative to P2.<br>Similarity test of P2 over E1.               | world, other mind           |
| 6    | Process dynamics   | D1. Repeated lossy compression deletes information irreversibly, giving an arrow of time.<br>D2. Assigning marginal code length to each retained change equips state space with a metric, distance equals cumulative cost. | S1 is lossy and monotone.<br>Cost per change defines distance.               | time, metric                |
| 7    | Vector code        | M1. Under the same capacity, bundling unresolved alternatives into a single weighted vector (superposition) costs O(n) fewer bits than n separate codes.² | Source‑coding efficiency forces this representation.                         | potential store             |
| 8    | Probability rule   | M2a. Additivity over the vector store is the cheapest bookkeeping; a non‑additive rule needs an exception table that breaks C1.<br>M2b. In a complex vector space of dimension ≥ 3, additive rules are uniquely quadratic (Gleason type). | Cost argument for additivity.<br>Mathematical uniqueness of quadratic weight. | quadratic weights           |
| 9    | Projection bound   | Q1. When a superposed vector hits capacity, the branch with the smallest marginal code extension is kept, all others collapse to one residual hash. | Minimal marginal cost satisfies C1.                                          | projection event            |
| 10   | Consensus layer    | Q2. Two finite agents that exchange compressed traces can agree only up to shared capacity; their overlap forms inter‑subjective reality, layered and local. | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                                    | inter‑subjective reality    |
| 11   | Geometric curve    | G1. If transition cost depends on the path, total code length shows non‑zero second‑order variance, equivalent to curvature in the cost metric. | Path‑dependent costs imply curvature tensor ≠ 0.                              | curvature                   |
| 12   | Energy analogue    | H1. Minimising average prediction cost under fixed capacity introduces a conserved scalar λ by Lagrange method; λ behaves like an energy analogue. | Constrained optimisation keeps λ constant along optimal trajectories.        | energy analogue             |

¹ “Simultaneous” means co‑instantiated in one phenomenological moment, no external time slice assumed.  
² A single vector stores n amplitude pairs in one header; separate codes repeat the header n times, losing O(n) bits under C1.

| 10   | Consensus layer    | Q2. Two finite agents exchanging compressed traces can agree only up to shared capacity; their overlap is inter‑subjective reality (layered / local). | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                              | inter‑subjective reality    |
| 11   | Geometric curve    | G1. If transition cost varies with path, the cost metric shows non‑zero second‑order variance ≡ curvature. | Path‑dependent costs imply curvature tensor ≠ 0.                       | curvature                   |
| 12   | Energy analogue    | H1. Minimising average prediction loss under fixed capacity introduces a conserved Lagrange multiplier that behaves like energy. | Constrained optimisation ⇒ constant multiplier.                        | energy analogue             |
