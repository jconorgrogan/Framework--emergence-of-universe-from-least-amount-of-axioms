If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!

|------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | Primitive datum    | **F0.** A feeling exists that contains multiple simultaneous contrasts.¹                                         | Denying any clause is itself a felt contrast (self‑instantiating).      | –                           |
| 1    | Phenomenology      | **F1.** Contrasts are numerous.<br>**F2\***. Some contrasts refer to contrasts no longer present.<br>**F3\***. Contrast intensities vary (salience). | F1 is direct from F0.<br>F2\*, F3\* are widespread empirical regularities, not logical necessities. | salience                    |
| 2    | Bottleneck         | **C1.** Observable selection pressure (F3\*) implies a finite bottleneck—either storage or access bandwidth.<br>**C2.** Finite bottleneck implies loss; references to absent contrasts (F2\*) reveal incompleteness. | Without a bottleneck, no contrast would dominate (salience would flatten).<br>Loss + reference = incompleteness. | capacity (bottleneck)       |
| 3    | Compression        | **S1.** A finite bottleneck forces selective retention of contrasts (compression).<br>**S2.** A retained trace that stands‑in for a discarded contrast functions as memory (lossy by nature, assuming F2\*). | From C1.<br>From C2 + F2\*.                                             | memory                      |
| 4    | Pattern extraction | **P1.** Under C1, any code that is not length‑minimal can be replaced by a shorter rival; only length‑minimal codes persist, yielding predictions.<br>**P2.** Predictions clustered around the host’s recurring contrasts form a proto‑self model (recursive tag, if such a cluster stabilises). | Code‑replacement argument.<br>Cluster centre ≙ locus of F0.             | prediction, self model      |
| 5    | World partition    | **E1.** Retained regularities not tagged self form a world model.<br>**E2.** Self‑like regularities inside that world model become models of other minds (accuracy variable). | Partition P1 relative to P2.<br>Similarity test of P2 over E1.          | world, other mind           |
| 6    | Process dynamics   | **D1.** Repeated lossy compression deletes information irreversibly, giving an arrow of time.<br>**D2.** Assigning marginal code length to each retained change equips state space with a metric (distance = cumulative cost). | S1 is lossy and monotone.<br>Cost per change defines distance.          | time, metric                |
| 7    | Vector code        | **M1.** Given a prefix‑free alphabet with magnitude + phase fields, bundling *n* unresolved alternatives into one weighted vector saves O(n) header bits versus storing them separately; hence it is the stable code under C1. | Source‑coding efficiency.                                               | potential store             |
| 8    | Probability rule   | **M2a.** Additive bookkeeping over the vector store minimises code length; non‑additive rules need exception tables that break C1.<br>**M2b.** In complex vector spaces of dimension ≥ 3, additive rules are uniquely quadratic (Gleason‑type).² | Cost argument for additivity.<br>Mathematical uniqueness of quadratic weights. | quadratic weights           |
| 9    | Projection bound   | **Q1.** When the superposed vector’s total header plus branch codes exceeds the bottleneck, the branch with the smallest marginal extension is kept; the rest collapse to one residual hash. | Minimal marginal cost satisfies C1.                                     | projection event            |
| 10   | Consensus layer    | **Q2.** Two self‑clusters (agents) exchanging compressed traces agree only up to shared code capacity; their overlap forms inter‑subjective reality, layered and local. | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                               | inter‑subjective reality    |
| 11   | Geometric curve    | **G1.** If transition cost depends on path (unequal sub‑code reuse), the cost metric shows non‑zero second‑order variance ⇒ curvature. | Path‑dependent costs ⇒ curvature tensor ≠ 0.                            | curvature                   |
| 12   | Energy analogue    | **H1.** Minimising average prediction cost under fixed capacity introduces a conserved scalar λ via Lagrange multipliers; λ behaves as an energy analogue. | Constrained optimisation keeps λ constant along optimal trajectories.   | energy analogue             |

¹ “Simultaneous” = co‑instantiated in one phenomenological moment; no external clock assumed.  
² If dimension < 3 or the algebra is non‑Hilbert, Gleason does not apply and alternative probability rules may persist.

\* Empirical regularity, not a strict logical necessity. Downstream tiers that reference F2\* or F3\* are conditional on their presence.
