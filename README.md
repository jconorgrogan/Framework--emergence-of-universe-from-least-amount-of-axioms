If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!# Felt‑Difference Ladder (v0.98)

0    | Primitive datum    | F0. A system stably recognises multiple phenomenal contrasts and can compare them across or within moments.       | Denying this is itself a recognised contrast. Comparison presupposes a buffer and finite channel. | memory, bottleneck
1    | Phenomenology      | F1. Contrasts are numerous.                                                                                       | Direct from F0.                                                         | salience
     |                    | F2. Each recognised contrast is held long enough to be compared (minimal memory).                                 | Implicit in “stably recognises”.                                        |
     |                    | F3. Finite channel forces some contrasts to dominate others (salience).                                           | Finite bandwidth ⇒ relative strength.                                   |
2    | Bottleneck         | C1. The finite channel acts as a bottleneck on storage or access.                                                 | Direct restatement of F0 implication.                                   | capacity
     |                    | C2. Because of the bottleneck, not all contrasts can persist; incompleteness follows.                             | Loss is inevitable.                                                     |
3    | Compression        | S1. Bottleneck forces selective retention (compression).                                                          | From C1.                                                                | memory trace
     |                    | S2. Retained traces stand in for discarded contrasts.                                                             | From C2.                                                                |
4    | Pattern extraction | P1. Any code that is not length‑minimal is replaced by a shorter rival under the fixed channel.                   | Greedy replacement logic.                                               | prediction
     |                    | P2. Predictions clustered around the locus of F0 form a proto‑self model.                                         | Cheapest pointer to recurring error.                                    | self model
5    | World partition    | E1. Regularities not in the self cluster form a world model.                                                      | Complement of P2.                                                       | world
     |                    | E2. Self‑like regularities inside the world model become models of other minds.                                   | Similarity test.                                                        | other mind
6    | Process dynamics   | D1. Repeated lossy compression is irreversible, giving an arrow of time.                                          | S1 is monotone.                                                         | time
     |                    | D2. Marginal code cost per change defines a distance; cumulative cost defines a metric.                           | Code theory.                                                            | metric
7    | Vector code        | M1. Bundling n unresolved alternatives into one complex vector saves O(n) header bits vs separate storage.        | Source‑coding efficiency.                                               | potential store
8    | Probability rule   | M2a. Additive bookkeeping is length‑minimal; non‑additive needs exception tables.<br>M2b. In complex spaces dim ≥ 3, additive rules are uniquely quadratic (Gleason type). | Cost plus theorem.                                                      | quadratic weights
9    | Projection bound   | Q1. When total header + branch codes exceed the channel, keep the branch with least marginal cost, hash the rest. | Minimal marginal cost.                                                  | projection event
10   | Consensus layer    | Q2. Two self‑clusters exchange compressed traces; overlap under shared channel forms inter‑subjective reality.    | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                               | inter‑subjective reality
11   | Geometric curve    | G1. If transition cost is path dependent, the metric’s second derivative is nonzero, hence curvature.             | Path dependence ⇒ curvature.                                            | curvature
12   | Energy analogue    | H1. Constrained minimisation of prediction cost introduces a conserved scalar λ (energy analogue).                | Lagrange multiplier is constant.                                        | energy analogue
