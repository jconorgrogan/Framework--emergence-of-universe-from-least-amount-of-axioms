There are several rival blueprints for what the universe is and why it exists. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory each offer a different ontology, yet they converge on one premise: information sits at the root of every description. No matter how the theories differ, all agree that something is being distinguished from something else.

If every road points to information, the deeper question becomes, where does information come from in the first place? Why should there be any distinction at all, any structure, any state that differs from another? We can go into that (I do here https://github.com/jconorgrogan/Why-there-is-something-and-not-nothing ) but I don't think that this is even the most basic set of assumptions we can start with. 

The most primitive information any conscious communicator can confirm is the fact of feeling. Strip away every abstraction and a single fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling already carries internal structure. "I have a feeling." This is our minimal axiom, F0: the felt contrast of experience.

From F0 alone, a surprising chain of consequences follows via information compression : Contrast implies limitation, limitation forces compression, compression yields memory, prediction, time, identity, and eventually the structured world we observe. 

But we don't even have to assume this most basic starting point. Alternatively, consider the negation: assume F0 is false, that reality is a uniform void with no distinction. As we will argue, the very act of considering or encoding this void introduces contrast, making T25 inherently unstable. The same logical dynamics that drive the previous path then force the system away from T25, compelling it towards structures that sustain contrast – structures that mirror those built in the previous Path, eventually requiring F0 itself. 


The ladder below formalizes this loop. The forward direction builds structure from felt contrast. The reverse direction shows that trying to erase contrast yields it again via the same compression logic. The beginning demands the end; the end returns to the beginning. It is highly speculative and requires significant formalization.

## 1. Foundational Tiers & Forward Logic Sketch (Generative Path F0 → T12+)

This table outlines the proposed generative sequence starting from F0. Each tier builds upon the structures and constraints established previously, driven by MDL/SUR.

## 3. The Two Paths to Reality: A Self-Locking Loop

### 3.1 Generative Path (F0 → T24)

Start with F0. Felt multiplicity and salience (T1) meet a bottleneck (T2), forcing compression (T3) via SUR (T3a). Patterns emerge (T4), forming predictive models and observers (T4.5). Observers partition world (T5), experience irreversible dynamics (T6), and develop structures via SUR (T6a), leading to Hilbert space (T7), probability (T8), projection (T9), consensus (T10), curvature (T11), energy analogue (T12), and eventually quantum fields and cosmology (T13–T23). Result: observers who instantiate F0 (T24), closing the loop.

### 3.3 Synthesis

The Generative Path builds structure from felt contrast.  
The Collapse Path shows that erasing contrast recreates it.  
Both use the same SUR/MDL logic.  
The ladder is a self-locking circle: F0 → … → T24 → T25 → F0.
