If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!

# Felt‑Difference Ladder (v1.2)  
From one phenomenological axiom to the core quantum postulates without extra physics assumptions.

| 0    | Primitive datum        | **F0.** A system stably recognises multiple phenomenal contrasts and can compare them across or within moments.                                                                            | Denying this is itself a recognised contrast. Comparison needs a buffer ⇒ memory. Physical realisation needs a finite channel ⇒ bottleneck. | memory, bottleneck    |
| 1    | Phenomenology          | **F1.** Numerous contrasts. <br> **F2.** Each contrast persists long enough for comparison (buffer). <br> **F3.** Finite channel means some contrasts dominate (salience).                 | Direct corollaries of F0.                                                                                                             | salience              |
| 2    | Bottleneck             | **C1.** The finite channel is a bottleneck on storage or access. <br> **C2.** Not all contrasts can persist, so incompleteness is unavoidable.                                             | Restatement of F0 capacity limit and its consequence.                                                                                 | capacity              |
| 3    | Compression            | **S1.** Bottleneck forces selective retention, that is compression. <br> **S2.** Retained traces act as lossy memory for discarded contrasts.                                             | From C1 and C2.                                                                                                                       | memory trace          |
| 3a   | SUR lemma (formal)     | **SUR.** In a finite channel, if code *b* is strictly shorter than *a* and yields equal prediction error, a stochastic rewrite rule replaces *a* by *b* in at most `⌈len(a)/ε⌉` updates. | ε free bits in *b* carry a replace‑pointer until overwrite. Length decreases monotonically, so the system converges to Kraft‑minimal codes. | —                     |
| 4    | Pattern extraction     | **P1.** SUR gives an MDL attractor: only length‑minimal codes are stable. <br> **Lemma MI.** Maximising mutual information under MDL pins a stable cluster around the comparison locus. | Redundant bits are pruned, best code keeps features that cut future error. The highest MI cluster is anchored at the point of feeling. | prediction, self      |
| 4.5  | Observer definition    | **O1.** An observer is an MDL compressor with a persistent MI‑max self‑cluster and a Δ_self capacity for self‑updates.                                                                    | Adds recursion needed for counterfactual prediction and identity persistence.                                                         | observer              |
| 5    | World partition        | **E1.** Regularities not tagged self form the world model. <br> **Lemma ToM.** Recurrent prediction errors around non‑self traces trigger a cheapest fix: a self‑simulation stub, hence other minds. | Complement rule plus cost of modelling agents.                                                                                        | world, other mind     |
| 6    | Process dynamics       | **D1.** Lossy compression is irreversible, giving an arrow of time. <br> **D2.** Marginal code cost defines distance; cumulative cost is an information metric\*.                        | S1 is monotone. Code cost accumulates along state changes.                                                                            | time, metric          |
| 6a   | Operational constraints| **R1.** Stored codes must be reversibly unpackable. <br> **R2.** Code cost is sub‑additive under composition. <br> **R3.** Distinguishable alternatives cannot be cloned.               | Required for predictive reuse under SUR and finite channel.                                                                           | —                     |
| 7a   | MIN‑1                  | Header sharing of *n* alternatives forces a bundled representation, a vector superposition.                                                                                                | Single prefix avoids O(n) header duplication.                                                                                         | potential store       |
| 7b   | MIN‑2                  | Reversibility plus sub‑additivity implies linear combination of those vectors.                                                                                                             | Group law for reversible updates gives vector addition.                                                                               | —                     |
| 7c   | MIN‑3                  | Non‑clonability and distinguishability force a two‑component magnitude–phase field, hence complex scalars and an inner product.                                                           | Real vectors give sign ambiguity, higher fields cost extra bits; complex is cheapest.                                                | complex amplitudes    |
| 8    | Probability rule       | **M2a.** Additivity minimises length, non‑additive measures need exception tables and break SUR. <br> **M2b.** In complex spaces dim ≥ 3, Gleason forces quadratic (Born) weights.         | Cost plus theorem gives unique probability rule.                                                                                     | quadratic weights     |
| 9    | Projection bound       | **Q1.** If total header + branch codes exceed capacity by σ (the header quantum), SUR prunes all but the branch with least marginal cost, then writes the outcome into memory.          | Full collapse is the only way to satisfy capacity with minimal loss.                                                                  | projection event      |
| 10   | Consensus layer        | **Q2.** Two observers exchange traces only in their shared code basis. Inter‑subjective reality is `Δ_proj_{C∩}(M₁) ∩ Δ_proj_{C∩}(M₂)`.                                                  | Basis compatibility and channel intersection define common truth.                                                                    | inter‑subjective reality |
| 11   | Geometric curve        | **G1.** Unequal sub‑code reuse on different paths makes second derivative of cost non‑zero, producing curvature; uniform reuse leaves geometry flat.                                     | Path dependent cost equals curvature tensor.                                                                                         | curvature             |
| 12   | Energy analogue        | **H1.** Minimising mean prediction cost under fixed capacity introduces λ, a conserved Lagrange multiplier. With cost Hamiltonian H, λ = ∂(min cost)/∂C = β = 1/kT.                       | Standard constrained optimisation maps λ to thermodynamic β.                                                                         | energy analogue       |

\* Triangle inequality holds if incremental costs are additive; if not, distance is a pseudo‑metric.

**Status**  
Everything through Tier 9 (state space, unitary superposition, Born probabilities, collapse) is now a deductive attractor of F0 plus the single dynamical rule SUR and operational constraints R1–R3. No extra physical postulates are imported.
