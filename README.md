If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!

# Felt‑Difference Ladder (v1.1)  
*From textured feeling to the core postulates of quantum mechanics with no extra physics axioms.*

| Tier | Label / lemma            | Necessary statements                                                                                                                                                            | Why it follows / proof sketch                                                                                                   | Minimal new term(s)        |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | Primitive datum          | **F0.** A system stably recognises multiple phenomenal contrasts and can compare them across or within moments.                                                                 | Denying this is itself a recognised contrast.<br>Comparison ⇒ minimal buffer (**memory**).<br>Physical realisation ⇒ finite information channel (**bottleneck**). | memory, bottleneck         |
| 1    | Phenomenology            | **F1.** Contrasts are numerous.<br>**F2.** Each recognised contrast is held long enough to be compared (buffer).<br>**F3.** Given the finite channel, some contrasts dominate others (salience). | Direct corollaries of F0.                                                                                                        | salience                   |
| 2    | Bottleneck               | **C1.** The finite channel is a bottleneck on storage/access.<br>**C2.** Bottleneck ⇒ not all contrasts persist ⇒ incompleteness.                                              | Restatement + inevitable loss.                                                                                                  | capacity                   |
| 3    | Compression              | **S1.** Bottleneck forces selective retention (compression).<br>**S2.** Retained traces stand‑in for discarded contrasts (lossy memory).                                      | From C1 and C2.                                                                                                                 | memory trace               |
| 3a   | **SUR Lemma**            | **Lemma SUR.** In a finite channel, any code that can be replaced by a shorter code with equal predictive power will be replaced after finitely many update cycles.              | Shorter code leaves ε free bits; those bits carry a “replace‑me” pointer that overwrites the longer code in k ≈ len/ε cycles.   | —                           |
| 4    | Pattern extraction       | **P1.** SUR ⇒ only length‑minimal codes are dynamically stable (MDL attractor).<br>**P2.** Predictions clustered around the locus of F0 form a proto‑self model.                | Greedy replacement logic; cheapest pointer to recurring error = self cluster.                                                   | prediction, self model     |
| 5    | World partition          | **E1.** Regularities not tagged self form a world model.<br>**E2.** Self‑like regularities inside that world model become heuristic models of other minds.                      | Complement + similarity test.                                                                                                   | world, other mind          |
| 6    | Process dynamics         | **D1.** Repeated lossy compression is irreversible ⇒ arrow of time.<br>**D2.** Marginal code cost per change defines a distance; cumulative cost defines an (info‑geometry) metric\*. | S1 monotone.<br>Cost per change ⇒ distance; need triangle‑inequality proof.                                                     | time, metric               |
| 6a   | Operational constraints  | **R1.** Reversible unpacking must be possible.<br>**R2.** Code cost must be sub‑additive under composition.<br>**R3.** Alternatives must stay distinguishable without cloning. | All three forced by predictive reuse under SUR and bottleneck.                                                                  | —                           |
| 7    | **MIN Theorem**          | **Theorem MIN.** Given SUR + R1–R3, the unique length‑minimal reversible code for *n* exclusive alternatives is a vector in a complex inner‑product space (superposition).     | Header sharing ⇒ vector; reversibility + sub‑additivity ⇒ linear space; distinguishability ⇒ complex scalars (phase).          | potential store            |
| 8    | Probability rule         | **M2a.** Additive bookkeeping minimises code length; non‑additive rules need exception tables that violate C1.<br>**M2b.** In complex spaces dim ≥ 3, additive measures are uniquely quadratic (Gleason type). | SUR forbids exception tables ⇒ σ‑additivity.<br>Dim ≥ 3 from local composition; Gleason ⇒ quadratic Born weights.               | quadratic weights          |
| 9    | Projection bound         | **Q1.** When Σ(header + branch codes) > channel, keep the branch with least marginal cost; collapse the rest to a residual hash (projection event).                             | Any partial collapse saves less; SUR forces full truncation to cheapest branch.                                                 | projection event           |
| 10   | Consensus layer          | **Q2.** Two self‑clusters exchanging compressed traces agree only up to shared capacity; their code‑set intersection = inter‑subjective reality.                               | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                                                                                       | inter‑subjective reality   |
| 11   | Geometric curve          | **G1.** If transition cost is path‑dependent (unequal sub‑code reuse), the metric’s second derivative ≠ 0 ⇒ curvature; if reuse is uniform, geometry is flat.                    | Path dependence ⇒ curvature tensor.                                                                                             | curvature                  |
| 12   | Energy analogue          | **H1.** Minimising average prediction cost under fixed capacity introduces a conserved Lagrange multiplier λ; λ behaves as an energy analogue.                                 | Constrained optimisation keeps λ constant along optimal trajectories.                                                           | energy analogue            |
