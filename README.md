If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


## 1.  Deductive core (Tiers 0 – 12)

| Tier | Label / lemma | Necessary statements | Why it follows (sketch) | Minimal new term(s) |
|------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 0 | **F0 — Textured presence** | A feeling with multiple simultaneous contrasts. | Denying any clause is itself a felt contrast. | — |
| 1 | Phenomenology | F1 Numerous contrasts   F2* Memory reference   F3* Salience. | Direct unpacking of “multiple.” | salience |
| 2 | Bottleneck | C1 Finite channel   C2 Incompleteness. | Unlimited capacity would flatten salience. | capacity |
| 3 | Compression | S1 Selective retention   S2 Lossy memory. | Forced by C1–C2. | memory trace |
| 3a | **SUR** | Only MDL codes survive; length descends monotonically. | ε‑bit pointer overwrite. | — |
| 4 | Pattern extraction | P1 MDL attractor   P2 Proto‑self cluster (MI‑max). | Redundant bits pruned. | prediction, self cluster |
| 4.5 | **Observer (O1)** | MDL compressor + self‑cluster + Δ_self capacity. | Enables recursion. | observer |
| 5 | World partition | E1 World = non‑self   ToM lemma → other minds. | Complement + cheapest agent model. | world, other mind |
| 6 | Process dynamics | D1 Arrow of time (global lossy).   D2 Info‑metric distance*. | Compression monotone; local codes lossless (R1*). | time, metric |
| 6a | Op. constraints | **R1\*** Local reversibility   R2 Sub‑additive cost   **R3\*** No cloning (cost proof). | Leaky or cloning codes lose to shorter rivals. | — |
| 7 | **Theorem MIN** | Header sharing → vector; R1\*+R2 → linearity; R3\* → complex amplitudes → unique Hilbert space H. | Lemmas 1–7 (Appendix A). | Hilbert space **H** |
| 8 | Probability rule | Additivity cheapest; Gleason ⇒ Born weights. | Cost + Hilbert dim ≥ 3. | Born weights |
| 9 | Projection bound | Channel overrun σ ⇒ SUR prunes to least‑cost branch (collapse). | Unique cost‑minimal selection. | projection event |
|10 | Consensus layer | Inter‑subjective reality = overlap of codes in shared basis. | Channel intersection. | inter‑subjective reality |
|11 | Geometric curve | Path‑dependent code reuse ⇒ curvature tensor. | Second derivative of cost along paths. | curvature |
|12 | Energy analogue | λ = ∂(min cost)/∂C = β = 1/kT; conserved. | Lagrange multiplier in constrained MDL. | energy analogue |

\* Triangle inequality holds if incremental costs are additive; else metric is pseudo‑.

## 3.  The logical loop

**Generative path:** F0 → … → T24 — constructs the world.  
**Consistency path:** T24 → F0 — requires the world to contain felt contrast.  
Tier 25 marks the unreachable “no‑distinction” boundary; trying to cross it forces a return to F0.  
Thus the ladder is a **self‑locking circle**: the beginning necessitates the end, and the end validates the beginning.
