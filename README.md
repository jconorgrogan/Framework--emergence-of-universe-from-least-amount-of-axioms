If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!

| Tier | Label              | Necessary statements                                                                                                                           | Why it follows                                                                                                                    | Minimal new term(s)      |
|------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0    | Primitive datum    | **F0.** A system stably recognises multiple phenomenal contrasts and can compare them across or within moments.                                | Denying this is itself a recognised contrast. <br>Comparison ⇒ a minimal buffer (**memory**). <br>Physical realisation ⇒ a finite information channel (**bottleneck**). | memory, bottleneck       |
| 1    | Phenomenology      | **F1.** Contrasts are numerous.<br>**F2.** Each recognised contrast is held long enough to be compared (minimal memory).<br>**F3.** Given the finite channel, some contrasts dominate others (salience). | F1 direct from “multiple”.<br>F2 direct corollary of comparison buffer.<br>F3 direct corollary of finite channel.                  | salience                 |
| 2    | Bottleneck         | **C1.** The finite channel acts as a bottleneck on storage or access.<br>**C2.** Because of the bottleneck, not all contrasts can persist; incompleteness follows. | Restatement of corollaries 0.1 & 0.2.<br>Loss is inevitable.                                                                      | capacity (bottleneck)    |
| 3    | Compression        | **S1.** Bottleneck forces selective retention—compression by discarding low‑value detail.<br>**S2.** Retained traces stand in for discarded contrasts (lossy memory). | From C1 and C2.                                                                                                                   | memory trace             |
| 4    | Pattern extraction | **P1.** Under a fixed channel, any code that is not length‑minimal is overwritten by a shorter rival (greedy replacement).<br>**P2.** Predictions clustered around the locus of F0 form a proto‑self model. | Replacement lemma + MDL logic.<br>Cheapest pointer to recurring error = self cluster.                                             | prediction, self model   |
| 5    | World partition    | **E1.** Regularities not tagged self form a world model (complement of P2).<br>**E2.** Self‑like regularities inside that world model become heuristic models of other minds. | Partition + similarity test.                                                                                                      | world, other mind        |
| 6    | Process dynamics   | **D1.** Repeated lossy compression is irreversible, giving an arrow of time.<br>**D2.** Marginal code cost per change defines a distance; cumulative cost defines an (info‑geometry) metric\*. | S1 is monotone.<br>Cost per change ⇒ distance; prove triangle inequality or call it pseudo‑metric.                                | time, metric             |
| 7    | Vector code        | **M1.** (Conjecture 7.1) Bundling *n* unresolved alternatives into one complex‑amplitude vector saves O(n) header bits vs separate storage, making it the length‑minimal superposition code. | Source‑coding efficiency under prefix alphabet with magnitude + phase headers.                                                    | potential store          |
| 8    | Probability rule   | **M2a.** Additive bookkeeping over the vector store minimises code length; non‑additive rules require exception tables that break C1.<br>**M2b.** In complex vector spaces of dim ≥ 3, additive measures are uniquely quadratic (Gleason type)\*\*. | Cost argument ⇒ additivity.<br>Theorem ⇒ quadratic weights (Born rule).                                                           | quadratic weights        |
| 9    | Projection bound   | **Q1.** When Σ(header + branch codes) > channel, retain the branch with least marginal cost; collapse the rest to a residual hash (projection event). | Minimal marginal cost satisfies C1 (forced selection threshold).                                                                  | projection event         |
| 10   | Consensus layer    | **Q2.** Two self‑clusters exchanging compressed traces agree only up to shared capacity; overlap of their code sets = inter‑subjective reality. | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                                                                                         | inter‑subjective reality |
| 11   | Geometric curve    | **G1.** If transition cost is path‑dependent (unequal sub‑code reuse), the metric’s second derivative ≠ 0, giving curvature; if reuse is uniform, geometry remains flat. | Path dependence ⇒ curvature tensor.                                                                                               | curvature                |
| 12   | Energy analogue    | **H1.** Minimising average prediction cost under fixed capacity yields a conserved Lagrange multiplier λ; λ behaves as an energy analogue.     | Constrained optimisation keeps λ constant along optimal trajectories.                                                             | energy analogue          |

\* Action item: prove triangle inequality; downgrade to pseudo‑metric if it fails.  
\*\* If dimension < 3 or space is non‑Hilbert, quadratic uniqueness need not hold.

**Conjecture 7.1:** Complex amplitude vectors are globally length‑minimal for large *n*; proof pending.
