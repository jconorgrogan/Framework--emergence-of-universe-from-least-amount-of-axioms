A real **Theory of Everything** must spell out what “everything” cannot exclude.  
Strip away particles, fields, and equations, and one brute fact remains: **something is being felt right now, and this feeling is internally textured**. I don't think any string theorist, or philosopher, or anyone else could deny this element as the simplest neccessity of what can't be forged or faked.

Interestingly, from that single premise, logic forces the rest. Internal contrast demands finite capacity; finite capacity forces compression and memory; compression yields time, pattern, world, and self.  
The universe we observe unfolds as a chain of necessities from the bare existence of felt difference.

|------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | Primitive datum    | F0. A feeling exists that contains multiple simultaneous contrasts.                                        | Denying any clause is itself a felt contrast (self-instantiating).     | –                           |
| 1    | Phenomenology      | F1. Contrasts are numerous.<br>F2. Some contrasts refer to contrasts no longer present.<br>F3. Contrasts vary in felt strength (salience). Salience is observed, not assumed. | Direct properties of F0.                                               | salience                    |
| 2    | Capacity limits    | C1. Unlimited storage would keep every micro‑contrast at equal strength, erasing salience (F3).<br>C2. Finite capacity implies loss; references to absent contrasts (F2) reveal incompleteness. | Contraposition of F3 ⇒ capacity is finite.<br>Contraposition of F2.    | capacity, incompleteness    |
| 3    | Compression        | S1. Finite capacity forces selective retention of contrasts (compression).<br>S2. A retained trace that stands‑in for a discarded contrast functions as memory (lossy by nature). | From C1.<br>From C2 + F2.                                              | memory                      |
| 4    | Pattern extraction | P1. Compression prefers regularities that minimise future description length, yielding predictions.<br>P2. Predictions clustered around the host’s recurring contrasts form a proto‑self model (recursive tag). | Minimum‑description‑length logic applied to S1.<br>Cluster centre = locus of F0. | prediction, self model      |
| 5    | World partition    | E1. Retained regularities not tagged self form a world model.<br>E2. Self‑like regularities inside the world model become models of other minds (accuracy variable). | Partition P1 relative to P2.<br>Similarity test of P2 over E1.         | world, other mind           |
| 6    | Process dynamics   | D1. Repeated lossy compression deletes information irreversibly, giving an arrow of time.<br>D2. Assigning a cost to each retained change equips state space with a metric (cost = distance). | S1 is lossy and monotone.<br>Cost per change defines distance.         | time, metric                |
| 7    | Vector code        | M1. Under the same capacity, bundling unresolved alternatives into one weighted vector (superposition) costs fewer bits than storing them separately. | Source‑coding efficiency.                                              | potential store             |
| 8    | Probability rule   | M2. Additivity over the vector store, plus Gleason-type theorems (dim ≥ 3, non‑contextual), forces quadratic probability weights. | Additive bookkeeping is cheapest; theorem then yields quadratic weights. | quadratic weights           |
| 9    | Projection bound   | Q1. When a superposed code hits capacity, it collapses to one outcome plus residual trace (forced split).   | C1 forces truncation of M1.                                            | projection event            |
| 10   | Consensus layer    | Q2. Two finite agents exchanging compressed traces can agree only up to shared capacity; their overlap is inter‑subjective reality (layered / local). | Channel limit ∩ memories.                                              | inter‑subjective reality    |
| 11   | Geometric curve    | G1. If transition cost varies with path, the cost metric shows non‑zero second‑order variance ≡ curvature. | Path‑dependent costs imply curvature tensor ≠ 0.                       | curvature                   |
| 12   | Energy analogue    | H1. Minimising average prediction loss under fixed capacity introduces a conserved Lagrange multiplier that behaves like energy. | Constrained optimisation ⇒ constant multiplier.                        | energy analogue             |
