Shower thought- A real Theory of Everything must first pin down what “everything” cannot exclude. Strip away particles, fields, and equations, and one brute fact remains: something is being felt right now, and this feeling is internally textured. From that single premise, logic forces the rest. Internal contrast demands finite capacity, finite capacity forces compression and memory, compression yields time, pattern, world, and self. In other words, the universe we observe follows as a chain of necessities from the bare existence of felt differenc

0    | Primitive datum   | F0. A feeling exists that contains multiple simultaneous contrasts.                                       | Denying any clause is itself a felt contrast (self‑instantiating).    | –
1    | Phenomenology     | F1. Contrasts are numerous.                                                                               | Direct property of F0.                                                 | salience
     |                   | F2. Some contrasts refer to contrasts no longer present.                                                  | Direct property of F0.                                                 |
     |                   | F3. Contrasts vary in felt strength (salience).  *Salience is observed, not assumed.*                     | Direct property of F0.                                                 |
2    | Capacity limits   | C1. Unlimited storage would keep every micro‑contrast at equal strength, erasing salience (F3).           | Contraposition of F3 ⇒ capacity is finite.                            | capacity, incompleteness
     |                   | C2. Finite capacity implies loss; references to absent contrasts (F2) reveal incompleteness.              | Contraposition of F2.                                                  |
3    | Compression       | S1. Finite capacity forces selective retention of contrasts (compression).                                | From C1.                                                               | memory
     |                   | S2. A retained trace that *stands‑in* for a discarded contrast functions as memory (lossy by nature).     | From C2 + F2.                                                          |
4    | Pattern extract.  | P1. Compression prefers regularities that minimise future description length, yielding predictions.       | Minimum‑description‑length logic applied to S1.                       | prediction, self model
     |                   | P2. Predictions clustered around the host’s recurring contrasts form a proto‑self model (recursive tag).  | Cluster centre = locus of F0.                                          |
5    | World partition   | E1. Retained regularities not tagged self form a world model.                                             | Partition P1 relative to P2.                                           | world, other mind
     |                   | E2. Self‑like regularities inside the world model become models of other minds (accuracy variable).       | Similarity test of P2 over E1.                                         |
6    | Process dynamics  | D1. Repeated lossy compression deletes information irreversibly, giving an arrow of time.                | S1 is lossy and monotone.                                              | time, metric
     |                   | D2. Assigning a cost to each retained change equips state space with a metric (cost = distance).           | Cost per change defines distance; path‑integrated.                     |
7    | Vector code       | M1. Under the same capacity, bundling unresolved alternatives into one weighted vector (superposition)    | Source‑coding efficiency → fewer bits than separate storage.           | potential store
8    | Probability rule  | M2. Additivity over the vector store, plus Gleason‑type theorems (dim ≥ 3, non‑contextual), forces        | Cheapest bookkeeping is additive; theorem yields quadratic weights.    | quadratic weights
     |                   |     quadratic probability weights.                                                                        |                                                                        |
9    | Projection bound  | Q1. When a superposed code hits capacity, it collapses to one outcome + residual trace (forced split).    | C1 forces truncation of M1.                                            | projection event
10   | Consensus layer   | Q2. Two finite agents exchanging compressed traces can agree only up to shared capacity;                  | Channel limit ∩ memories = inter‑subjective reality (layered/local).   | inter‑subjective reality
     |                   |     their overlap is inter‑subjective reality.                                                            |                                                                        |
11   | Geometric curve   | G1. If transition cost varies with path, the cost metric shows non‑zero second‑order variance ≡ curvature.| Path‑dependent costs ⇒ curvature tensor ≠ 0.                           | curvature
12   | Energy analogue   | H1. Minimising average prediction loss under fixed capacity introduces a conserved Lagrange multiplier    | Constrained optimisation ⇒ constant multiplier (energy‑like).          | energy analogue
