If a Theory of Everything is to live up to its name, it has to account for what cannot be excluded.

Strip away all abstraction, and only one brute fact remains: something is being felt, and that feeling is internally structured.

No equation or ontology escapes this. It is the minimal undeniable datum: the felt contrast of experience.

From that alone, everything else follows. Contrast implies limitation, limitation demands compression, and compression yields memory, time, identity, and world.

What we call "reality" could be just the necessary closure of this system which is structure unfolding from the bare existence of felt difference. It seems a bit crazy but the logic seems sound; LMK if I'm missing anything obvious


Note- as we get lower in the tiers, more assumptions seem to pop up; Im more confident in the single digit numbers. Any and all feedback appreciated!# Felt‑Difference Ladder (v1.3)

**Appendix A:** full proof outline with Lemmas 1‑7 shows Theorem MIN is deduced from SUR + R1–R3.  
Thus, up to projection (Tier 9) quantum structure is a forced attractor of the single phenomenological axiom F0 under finite‑channel MDL dynamics—no extra physical postulates invoked.


**Status**  
Everything through Tier 9 (state space, unitary superposition, Born probabilities, collapse) is now a deductive attractor of F0 plus the single dynamical rule SUR and operational constraints R1–R3. No extra physical postulates are imported.
