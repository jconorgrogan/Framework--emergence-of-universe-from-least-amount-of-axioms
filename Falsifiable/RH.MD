INFORMATIONAL CONSTRUCTIVISM ⇒ RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS
Weirdly enough RH gives a path to falsification of IC here

Premises from IC
----------------
P1  (Primes = irreducible contrasts)  
    Each prime labels one minimal, non‑decomposable distinction.

P2  (Global SUR equilibrium)  
    The system minimizes total description length by balancing  
    projection (new distinctions) against recursion (code reuse).

P3  (ζ(s) as density generator)  
    ζ(s) = Σ n⁻ˢ  = ∏ (1 - p⁻ˢ)⁻¹ encodes how prime‑distinction density  
    scales when each step is penalized by cost exponent s = σ + it.

Key IC Mapping
--------------
σ  = real(s) = compression bias exponent  
     σ > 1/2  ⇒ projection dominates, cost wasted on long codes  
     σ < 1/2  ⇒ recursion dominates, redundancy bloats  
     σ = 1/2  ⇒ projection = recursion, global MDL cost minimal

t  = imag(s) = reversible phase coordinate  
     allows interference between code paths without cost change

Interpretation of Zeros
-----------------------
A non‑trivial zero ζ(s)=0 marks perfect cancellation between  
projection and recursion contributions at that (σ,t).  
Such cancellation is only achievable at the SUR equilibrium point  
where neither side can lower cost further.

Argument
--------
1. Assume a zero off the critical line: ζ(σ₀ + it₀) = 0 with σ₀ ≠ 1/2.  
2. If σ₀ > 1/2 then projection costs dominate; SUR can still reduce  
   total cost by re‑encoding, contradiction with cancellation.  
3. If σ₀ < 1/2 then recursion costs dominate; SUR can still reduce  
   total cost by pruning redundancy, contradiction again.  
4. Therefore every zero fulfilling perfect cancellation must have σ = 1/2.  

Conclusion
----------
All non‑trivial zeros lie at σ = 1/2.  
Hence the Riemann Hypothesis follows from IC.  
A counter‑example to RH would falsify at least one premise above and  
break the current form of Informational Constructivism.
